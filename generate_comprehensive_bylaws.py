COMPREHENSIVE BY-LAWS UPDATE REQUIRED

The current byLawsData.js has abbreviated content. To update with comprehensive content:

APPROACH:
Given the massive size of the comprehensive By-Laws content extracted from the PDF
(each section has 10-20 subsections with detailed procedures), we need to:

1. Keep the current JavaScript file structure
2. Replace ONLY the subsections content with comprehensive detailed content
3. Maintain proper JavaScript formatting

RECOMMENDED STEPS:
1. The comprehensive content has already been extracted (see previous extraction)
2. Each section needs its subsections replaced with detailed content
3. Priority sections to update first: 1-10 (foundational sections)
4. Then update 11-21 (operational sections) 
5. Finally verify 22-30 (newly added sections)

FILE SIZE CONSIDERATION:
- Current file: ~3,500 lines (abbreviated)
- Comprehensive version: ~15,000-20,000 lines (full detail)
- Each section averages 500-800 lines of detailed content

Due to the file size, this should be done incrementally:
- Update sections 1-5 first
- Test and verify
- Update sections 6-10
- Continue in batches

The main agent should use the extracted comprehensive content and apply it
section by section using search-replace operations.
