    content: `Koyili Hospital, in its commitment to uphold excellence in healthcare delivery and institutional governance, recognises Human Resources (HR) as a foundational pillar for sustainable, ethical, and patient-centric operations. The quality, conduct, and performance of its personnel directly influence clinical outcomes, organisational integrity, and compliance with statutory, regulatory, and accreditation mandates.

In furtherance of this vision, the present compendium of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) has been developed as a structured, codified, and institutionally approved framework governing the entire lifecycle of human resource management.

These SOPs are designed to:
• Establish consistency in HR operations across all departments and staff categories
• Ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in workforce management
• Provide a unified reference for policy implementation, review, and improvement
• Facilitate institutional preparedness for internal and external audits, including NABH, statutory inspections, and quality accreditation processes
• Promote a culture of professionalism, inclusivity, and ethical conduct in accordance with the hospital's mission and values

These SOPs shall apply uniformly to all categories of personnel—medical, paramedical, administrative, technical, and contractual—who are engaged in services at Koyili Hospital, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, or visiting in nature.

Each section herein is interlinked with designated annexures, forms, and compliance templates, and is subject to periodic review by the HR Department in consultation with the Quality Assurance Cell, Senior Management, and Statutory Authorities, as applicable.

This document shall be deemed a controlled institutional publication. Any modification, deviation, or interpretation of the SOPs shall require formal approval in accordance with the governance and version control procedures laid down in this manual.`
