The AI engineer's work involved an iterative expansion of the Administrative Annexures module for Koyili Hospital HRMS. Initially, forms (C2-C5, D1) were integrated, followed by batches (D2-D5, E1, E2-E5, then F1-F5). A critical issue with  (escaped newlines) was resolved by file recreation. The trajectory describes the successful implementation of F2-F5 and G1-G5 forms, converting user-provided HTML into high-quality React components and integrating them into , updating sidebar counts. Subsequently, the user requested branding standardization across all 39 annexure forms (A1-G5). After initial attempts and user feedback, a compact, professional, NABH-compliant design with a blue gradient header/footer was approved. This design has been applied to all F and G series forms, and the engineer is currently employing a bulk-update script to systematically apply it to the remaining 26 forms (A-E series) for maximum efficiency.

The user requires a modern, enterprise-themed HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital with a blue-gold aesthetic. It needs to support core HR functionalities and professionally display legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures) with high-standard typography, section-based navigation, a dedicated sidebar, and board approval banners. Key features include an HR SOPs Dashboard and an AI-Powered Ready Reckoner. For the Professional Administrative Annexures module, the goal is to integrate a growing list of administrative forms (currently A1-G5) provided as HTML drafts. These must be transformed into interactive React forms featuring hospital branding, logo, standardized header/footer, save/load/validation, digital signatures, auto-save, progress tracking, and professional PDF export, adhering to fantastic design and layout per international (NABH) standards. The current phase focuses on standardizing the branding across all 39 implemented annexure forms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully created and integrated all F1-F5 and G1-G5 professional annexure forms from user-provided HTML, bringing the total number of professional forms to 39 within the  module. The primary focus then shifted to standardizing the branding, header, and footer across all 39 forms to achieve a consistent, professional, NABH-compliant appearance.

This standardization involved:
1.  **Initial Design & Feedback**: Sample updates to  and  were made. During this,  experienced JSX compilation errors due to unbalanced  tags, which were debugged and fixed. User feedback requested a more compact header and a blue gradient footer matching the header.
2.  **Refined Design & Approval**: A compact header (logo left, hospital details center, document info right) and a matching blue gradient footer were applied to  and . This refined design was approved by the user.
3.  **Systematic Application**:
    *   The new design was successfully applied to  through .
    *   The new design was successfully applied to  through .
    *   The frontend was restarted and confirmed that all F and G series forms (10 forms) now exhibit the standardized design.
    *   The engineer is currently engaged in applying this design to the remaining 29 forms (A1-A4, B1-B10, C1-C5, D1-D5, E1-E5).  has been updated. The engineer is now preparing and executing an automated Python script for batch-updating the remaining 26 forms (E2-E5, plus C, D, B, A series) for maximum efficiency.
