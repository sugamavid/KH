The previous AI engineer's work focused on two main iterative development phases: integrating new HRMS annexure forms and transforming the Administrative Annexures dashboard into an intelligent automation hub, followed by an update to the By-Laws section. Initially, the engineer systematically processed batches of HTML forms, converting them into React components (), standardizing branding, and integrating them into . This involved updating imports, form arrays, render logic, and form counts, eventually reaching 76 integrated forms (A1-N4). Subsequently, the engineer revamped the Administrative Annexures dashboard, replacing static content with a dynamic Smart Tools Hub featuring AI-powered tools and enhanced UI/UX. Finally, the By-Laws section was extended by adding missing content for sections 11-21.

The user initially requested a modern, enterprise-themed HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital, featuring a blue-gold aesthetic and supporting core HR functions. A critical module, Professional Administrative Annexures, needed to integrate a continuously expanding set of administrative forms. This involved fixing JSX errors and standardizing branding for initial forms (A1-G5), then integrating subsequent batches (H1-M3, M4-M5, N1-N4), totaling 76 forms. Each form, provided as HTML drafts, must be transformed into interactive React components with hospital branding, logo, standardized header/footer, save/load/validation, digital signatures, auto-save, progress tracking, and professional PDF export, adhering to NABH standards.

Later, the user requested to transform the Administrative Annexures dashboard into a world-class, AI-powered administrative automation hub, replacing previous content with interactive tools and a better design. This new dashboard should contain various tools inspired by the annexures content and cater to daily hospital administration and legal system needs. Crucially, the sidebar with all 76 forms had to be retained. Finally, the user identified missing content in the By-Laws section from section 10 onwards, requiring an expansion to include comprehensive by-laws sections.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the task of expanding the By-Laws section. The user had reported that sections from 10 onwards were missing. The engineer located the  file and added detailed content for sections 11 through 21, which are typical for comprehensive hospital HR by-laws. After modifying the data file, the frontend was restarted, and screenshots were taken to verify that all 21 sections are now correctly showing in the By-Laws sidebar, ensuring completeness and proper organization of the by-laws content. This concludes the latest explicit user request for the By-Laws section.
