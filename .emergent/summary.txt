The AI engineer's work primarily focused on developing an HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital, with a strong emphasis on detailed legal document presentation. Initial efforts involved enhancing By-Laws and creating an interactive Annexures system. A significant portion of the work was dedicated to populating  with comprehensive content, iteratively addressing user feedback on completeness and structural integrity.

Subsequently, the engineer implemented Training, Reports, and Tools modules. Major work then shifted to expanding  with detailed form content and fixing PDF download functionality. Critical user feedback on the amateur design of SOPs led to multiple design iterations and debugging efforts in , resolving runtime errors, navigation issues, and integrating hospital branding. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively expanding the remaining Annexure content, specifically Annexures V, VI, and VII.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital with a modern enterprise design aesthetic (inspired by SAP SuccessFactors/Workday, Notion) using a blue-gold theme. It must include modules for Employee Lifecycle, Leave, Payroll, Document Management, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools. A core, repeated requirement is the *exact, full content* presentation of legal documents: By-Laws, SOPs, and Annexures, with justified text, elegant typography, section-based navigation, a dedicated sidebar, and a prominent board approval banner. The previous engineer delivered the UI for By-Laws and an interactive system for Annexures. The ongoing critical task involves providing complete, detailed content for all documents (e.g., a 115-page By-Laws document), and ensuring the UI/UX for these legal documents adheres to a high international professional standard, including proper branding, layout, and a clean, minimalist design, as per continuous user feedback on SOP presentation.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central routing for HR modules, handles conditional sidebar visibility. Modified to integrate new modules and updated routing.
-   ****: Displays HR By-Laws. Enhanced with a premium UI, board approval banner, and professional typography.
-   ****: Data source for By-Laws. Systematically expanded to include comprehensive content for 30 sections, covering a 115-page document. Its size increased from approximately 1200 to over 2600 lines through iterative updates and content corrections.
-   ****: Displays HR SOPs. Underwent significant iterative redesigns to achieve a professional, international standard layout as per user feedback. Key changes included dynamic navigation from , enhanced  for nested subsections, removal of Document No. SOP A.1 from headers, integration of the Koyili Hospital logo, and extensive cleanup of orphaned JSX elements.
-   ****: Data source for SOPs. Initially had mixed content detail. Systematically expanded with comprehensive content for Section B (Recruitment) SOPs (B.1-B.10), and portions of Section F (Leave Management). The file size increased from 1054 lines to 2337 lines.
-   ****: New component for interactive HR Annexures. Provides a dashboard, category grid, form views, and action buttons. Updated to display detailed form content and PDF download functionality. A runtime error () related to category clicks was fixed.
-   ****: Data source for Annexures. Expanded with detailed content for Annexures 1-3, 8, and Annexure 4 (Performance Management). It grew from 162 lines to 1060 lines, and further expansion is in progress.
-   ****: Created during the trajectory as a placeholder for the Training module.
-   ****: Created during the trajectory as a placeholder for the Reports module.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining HRMS modules (Training and Reports) with detailed content and functionality.
-   Implement ready reckoner tools as interactive calculators within .
-   Ensure forms (e.g., annexures) are actual downloadable PDFs with information cards, not just HTML representations.
-   Develop functionality for adding more departments dynamically.
-   Complete the remaining expansion of  (specifically Annexures V, VI, VII, IX, X).
-   Continue expanding the remaining SOPs in  with comprehensive content (e.g., Section F - Leave Management).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on expanding the content of  as per the user's explicit request to proceed with next as per plan for annexures. The work involved adding detailed content for specific annexure sections. So far, Annexures 1-3 and 8 have been completed, and Annexure 4 (Performance Management) was recently expanded, causing the  file to grow from 831 lines to 1060 lines. The current task at the very end of the trajectory is to continue this content expansion for Annexures V, VI, and VII. The AI had just located the relevant sections in  to proceed with injecting comprehensive content. This follows extensive work on SOP UI/UX, fixing several design and display issues.
