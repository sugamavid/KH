The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack application for a hospital dashboard. Initially, a basic dashboard was created, but the user iterated heavily on design and professionalism, particularly for the login page, header, sidebar, and footer, demanding international legal standard quality. The AI meticulously refined these elements, adding animations, responsive design, and addressing layout issues like overlapping. Concurrently, the backend was set up with initial data seeding for departments. The project then shifted to building a comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS) dashboard, including modules like Employee Management, Attendance/Leave, Payroll, Performance, and Legal Operations. The AI is currently in the process of building out these HRMS modules incrementally as per user's explicit request.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an interactive dashboard for a hospital client, Koyili Hospital, focusing on various departments. The initial request evolved into a multi-department interactive dashboard, starting with a Human Resources (HR) department dashboard. Key requirements include:
- A **professional, international standard login page** with the hospital logo, name (Koyili Hospital, in block letters), address (Koyili Hospital, Pallikkunnu, PO, Talap, Kannur, Kerala 670002), phone (0497 271 4400), and email (format and designs, animations, and color coordination to be world-class). The email and phone should be on a single row.
- After login, a **main dashboard landing page** with a header, footer, and a navigation sidebar for all departments (with the ability to add more departments later). The main content area should be interactive and informative.
- **Professional design and layout** for the dashboard, header, sidebar, and footer, adhering to best international legal standards.
- The dashboard must be **optimized for all major screen sizes**.
- A **comprehensive and detailed Human Resource Management System (HRMS) dashboard** as a specific department view. This HRMS should include:
    - All HR data populated from provided documents (bylaws, SOPs, annexures, ready reckoner tools).
    - Modules like Employee Management, Attendance/Leave, Payroll Management, Performance Management.
    - A crucial **Legal Operations and Compliance** module with options for SOPs, bylaws, annexures, and contracts.
    - Demo employee data should be populated.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is explicitly not required initially.
    - Forms (e.g., annexures) should be actual downloadable PDFs along with information cards.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively developing the **Human Resource Management System (HRMS) dashboard** within the hospital application. This involves building out all core modules as per the user's request for a comprehensive and detailed system.

Specifically, the following HR-specific components have been created:
-   : A file to hold demo employee data, allowing immediate population and testing of HRMS features.
-   : A dedicated sidebar for the HR department, likely containing navigation links specific to HR modules.
-   : The main landing page component for the HR dashboard, serving as the central hub for HR-related information.
-   : A module for managing employee records, likely including details like personal information, employment history, etc.
-   : A module to handle employee attendance and leave requests/tracking.
-   : A module for managing employee payroll.
-   : A module to track and manage employee performance.
-   : A crucial module dedicated to legal operations and compliance, which will house SOPs, bylaws, annexures, and contracts as requested by the user.

The AI is currently in the process of creating the remaining HRMS modules, having just completed the Legal Operations module. The focus is on implementing all modules fully and ensuring legal operations are present and functional.
