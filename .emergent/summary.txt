The previous AI engineerâ€™s work involved several phases. Initially, it focused on integrating 76 HRMS annexure forms (A1-N4) and transforming the Administrative Annexures dashboard into a Smart Tools Hub. This was followed by an expansion of the By-Laws section (11-21). Subsequently, the engineer enhanced the Training and Reports modules. A critical session management issue during testing led to a complete overhaul of the authentication system to use JWT. After resolving login issues and confirming functionality, the user redirected focus to By-Laws and SOPs. The engineer is currently in the process of completing the By-Laws section to 30 comprehensive entries using external asset files and plans to address SOP content next.

The initial request was for a modern HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital with a blue-gold theme, focusing on Professional Administrative Annexures. This required integrating 76 HTML forms (A1-N4) as interactive React components with standardized branding, save/load/validation, digital signatures, auto-save, progress tracking, and PDF export, adhering to NABH standards. Later, the user requested to transform the Administrative Annexures dashboard into an AI-powered administrative automation hub, retaining the 76-form sidebar. The By-Laws section needed expansion to include comprehensive content from section 10 onwards, eventually clarified as 30 sections. Pending tasks included completing Training and Reports modules, enabling dynamic department management, and aligning committees in  with . The latest user request is to complete the By-Laws to 30 sections and address missing content in various SOPs.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to make the By-Laws and SOPs content comprehensive. The engineer confirmed that  currently only contains 21 sections, despite the user's requirement for 30. The AI engineer successfully located and extracted the complete 30-section By-Laws content from an external asset. The next immediate step is to update  with this comprehensive data. Following this, the engineer plans to investigate and update the content for various Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which the user reported as incomplete under process and other headings within the  module. This directly addresses the latest explicit user request.
