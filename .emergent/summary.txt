The AI engineer's work has progressed through several iterative phases, beginning with establishing a professional hospital dashboard UI, heavily influenced by user feedback on international legal standard design for the login, header, sidebar, and footer. The core focus then shifted to building a comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS). This involved creating numerous HR-specific modules like Employee Management, Attendance/Leave, Payroll, Performance, Legal Operations, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools. Significant effort was dedicated to refactoring UI components, such as the main dashboard and HR-specific sidebars, to improve user experience, including conditional sidebar display and Back to Dashboard navigation. The development cycle included identifying and resolving multiple frontend syntax errors (e.g., in  and ) and module duplication issues, demonstrating robust debugging capabilities. Most recently, the work has centered on a highly detailed and legally compliant presentation of HR By-Laws, requiring precise content extraction from a user-provided PDF and the design of a dedicated, interactive navigation system. The current challenge is to implement this complex By-Laws system.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a hospital dashboard for Koyili Hospital, starting with a Human Resources (HR) department view. Key requirements include:

-   A highly professional, international standard login page with specific hospital branding (logo, name, address, phone, email in a single row), enhanced with animations and world-class design.
-   A main dashboard post-login with a professional header, footer, and a navigation sidebar for departments (extensible for future departments).
-   Responsive design and layout for all UI elements across various screen sizes.
-   A comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS) dashboard, encompassing:
    -   Employee Lifecycle Management (onboarding, exit workflows, document verification, clearance checklists).
    -   Advanced Leave Module (accrual, approval workflows, calendar synced with attendance).
    -   Payroll & Compensation (salary computation, reimbursements, bonus, automated salary slip generation).
    -   Document Management (central repository for employee files, contracts, compliance certificates with expiry alerts, download/export).
    -   Performance Management, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools modules.
    -   Demo employee data population (RBAC explicitly not required initially).
    -   Forms (e.g., annexures) as downloadable PDFs with information cards.
-   Dashboard Layout Preferences: Hybrid design with Executive Summary KPIs, Widget-Based Sections, and Tab-Based Categories (HR Operations | Leave & Payroll | Documents | Reports).
-   Design & UI Standards: Modern Enterprise (SAP SuccessFactors/Workday inspired with Notion minimalism), international appearance, local adaptability, Koyili Hospital and Avid Legal's blue-gold color themes.
-   Specific handling for legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures): Content to be exact from provided documents, presented with professional formatting (justified text, proper fonts for headings/subheadings, bullets), interactive navigation (e.g., for 30 By-Laws sections), a dedicated sidebar for legal documents (independent from HR sidebar), hiding the main HR sidebar when viewing legal documents, and a board approval banner.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a significant enhancement to the HR By-Laws section. The user explicitly requested a highly professional legal document viewer for the HR By-Laws, emphasizing:
1.  **Hiding the main HR sidebar** when By-Laws (or SOPs/Annexures) are open.
2.  Creating a **separate, dedicated navigation sidebar** specifically for the By-Laws document, featuring clickable links to its 30 distinct sections.
3.  Displaying the **exact content** extracted from the user-provided 115-page By-Laws PDF, without alteration.
4.  Ensuring **superior professional design and formatting** for legal documents (justified text, proper typography for headings/subheadings, bullet points).
5.  Including a **board approval banner.**

The AI successfully extracted the content from the provided By-Laws PDF (Chat 218) and recognized the complexity and scope of this task (Chat 219), confirming the 30 sections over 115 pages. The AI is currently in the process of formulating a plan to implement these detailed requirements and is seeking user confirmation for the next steps.
