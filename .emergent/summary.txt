The AI engineer primarily focused on systematically expanding all SOP sections (J-N) in  to a total of 70 SOPs and 15,284 lines, including debugging syntax errors. Subsequently, the user identified critical issues with By-Laws: incorrect content (engineer-generated instead of user-provided), and improper formatting/rendering in , including the lack of sidebar subsections. The engineer then retrieved the user's original By-Laws and began replacing content in  in batches. This led to a data structure mismatch between  and , causing By-Laws content to not render, and currently the application is stuck on the login page, indicating a deeper rendering or routing issue needing immediate attention.

The user requires a professional HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital with a modern enterprise design aesthetic, featuring a blue-gold theme. Key modules include Employee Lifecycle, Leave, Payroll, Document Management, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools. A core requirement is the exact, full content presentation of legal documents like By-Laws, SOPs, and Annexures, necessitating justified text, elegant typography, section-based navigation, a dedicated sidebar, and a prominent board approval banner. The previous engineer delivered the UI for By-Laws and an interactive system for Annexures. The ongoing critical task involves providing complete, detailed content for all documents, ensuring the UI/UX for these legal documents adheres to a high international professional standard, including proper branding, layout, and a clean, minimalist design. The immediate priority is the accurate integration and display of the user's original By-Laws content.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/hr/byLawsData.js**: Source of content for HR By-Laws. Was initially populated with generated content, then systematically replaced (Preamble and Sections 1-5) with user-provided content. The structure was modified from a flat object to a nested array, then reverted to a flat object format to align with 's expectations. Includes .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/hr/sopsData.js**: Source of content for HR SOPs. All 14 sections (A-N), comprising 70 SOPs, have been fully expanded with detailed content. The file size increased to 15,284 lines. Multiple syntax errors (unescaped apostrophes) were debugged and fixed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/hr/HRByLaws.jsx**: React component for rendering HR By-Laws. Modified to improve preamble formatting, render subsections in content, and enhance the sidebar for subsection navigation. It expects  to export a flat object where sections are directly accessible properties.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/hr/HRSOPs.jsx**: React component for displaying HR SOPs. Previously updated for justified text, uniform spacing, proper bullets, a styled footer, and reorganized header for a professional legal document look.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining HRMS modules (Training and Reports) with detailed content and functionality.
-   Implement ready reckoner tools as interactive calculators within .
-   Ensure forms (e.g., annexures) are actual downloadable PDFs with information cards.
-   Develop functionality for adding more departments dynamically.
-   **CRITICAL**: Complete the replacement of all 30 By-Laws sections in  with the user's original content.
-   **IMMEDIATE**: Resolve the current By-Laws content rendering issue, preventing the login page from showing instead of the By-Laws.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's critical feedback regarding By-Laws content and rendering. The user reported that the By-Laws content was not their original and that the Preamble and Sections 1-5 were not visible, with the application redirecting to the login page.
The engineer successfully obtained the user's original By-Laws (text and Word files) and began replacing the content in . The initial batch of the Preamble and Sections 1-5 was integrated, and  was re-added to resolve an import error. However, a crucial data structure mismatch was identified: the  component expected a flat object structure for By-Laws data, but the  file was temporarily structured with a nested array. After attempting to revert  to the expected flat structure, the application continued to show the login page, indicating the By-Laws content is still not rendering correctly or a new issue is preventing the component from loading properly.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the application is displaying the login page and not the By-Laws content, and ensure the preamble and Sections 1-5 are rendered correctly.
