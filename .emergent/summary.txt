The AI engineer's work primarily focused on expanding an HRMS dashboard, specifically on handling legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures). Initial efforts built core UI components and general HR modules. A key user request was to display *exact, full content* from PDFs, not summaries. The engineer successfully created  and  with dedicated navigation and search. Following user prioritization, the engineer completed content extraction and  update. However, the user reported  was still incomplete, prompting the engineer to re-extract and prepare to update the By-Laws content fully. This highlights an iterative refinement process, focusing on precise content integration and UI/UX for complex documents.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional hospital dashboard for Koyili Hospital with an extensive Human Resources Management System (HRMS). This includes a branded login, main dashboard with a flexible header, footer, and navigation sidebar. The HRMS must encompass Employee Lifecycle, Advanced Leave, Payroll & Compensation, Document Management, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools. Design should be modern enterprise (SAP SuccessFactors/Workday inspired with Notion minimalism), international, locally adaptable, and use Koyili Hospital/Avid Legal's blue-gold theme.

A critical, ongoing requirement involves legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures). Their content must be extracted *exactly* from provided PDFs, presented with professional formatting (justified text, typography, bullets), interactive section-based navigation (e.g., 30 By-Laws sections), a dedicated sidebar for legal documents, dynamic hiding of the main HR sidebar when viewing these, and a board approval banner.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX Design**: Tailwind CSS, responsive design, custom animations, international standard aesthetic.
-   **Data Handling**: MongoDB for persistence, demo data seeding (), comprehensive document content extraction from PDFs.
-   **API Communication**: Frontend consumes backend APIs via  with  prefix.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central container and router for HR modules. Modified to conditionally hide the HR sidebar when  is 'hr-bylaws', 'hr-sops', or 'hr-annexures', and passes  to children.
-   ****: Displays HR By-Laws. Created and rebuilt for dedicated navigation, search, Back to HR Dashboard button, and to accept . Intended to display full extracted PDF content.
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR By-Laws. Was initially incomplete (30 sections) but is slated for a full update with the complete, detailed content extracted from the 115-page PDF.
-   ****: Displays HR Standard Operating Procedures. Created and transformed to match  layout (sidebar, search).
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR SOPs. Has been updated with complete, detailed content extracted from its respective PDF across multiple edits, including adding sections (C through N) and quick references.
-   ****: Displays HR Annexures. Currently a placeholder, expected to follow a similar comprehensive layout.
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR Annexures. Currently placeholder, to be updated with complete content.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully extracted the complete detailed content for the SOPs PDF and updated the  file with this comprehensive information, including multiple sections and quick references. The frontend was confirmed to compile successfully after these updates.

However, the user reported that the  component was still displaying incomplete content (still half). The AI engineer investigated, confirmed  was indeed incomplete (only 30 sections), and re-initiated the extraction of the complete By-Laws content from its 115-page PDF. The extraction was successfully completed again, and the AI engineer is currently preparing to update the  file with this newly extracted, comprehensive content. The user has prioritized By-Laws and SOPs before Annexures.
