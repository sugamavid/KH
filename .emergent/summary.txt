The AI engineer's work primarily revolves around iteratively integrating new HRMS annexure forms into the Koyili Hospital application. Starting from an initial set of 39 problematic forms (A1-G5), the engineer systematically recreated and validated them to resolve JSX errors and standardize branding. Subsequently, new batches of HTML forms (H1-H5, H6 & I1-I4, I6 & J1-J4, J5-J6 & K1-K3, K4-K5 & L1-L3, I5, L4-L5 & M1-M3, and M4-M5 & N1-N3) were received. For each batch, the approach involved extracting content, creating new React components () with standardized branding and dynamic features, verifying JSX balance, and integrating them into  by updating imports, the form array, form mappings, and the total count. The total number of integrated forms has increased to 70, with the engineer currently poised to begin integrating the latest batch (M4-M5, N1-N3).

The user requires a modern, enterprise-themed HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital, featuring a blue-gold aesthetic and supporting core HR functions. A critical module is Professional Administrative Annexures, designed to integrate a continuously expanding set of administrative forms. Initially, 39 forms (A1-G5) needed branding standardization and JSX error resolution. This was expanded to include H1-H5, H6 & I1-I4, I6 & J1-J4, J5-J6 & K1-K3, K4-K5 & L1-L3, I5, L4-L5 & M1-M3. The current count stands at 70 integrated forms, with the next batch being M4-M5 and N1-N3. Each form, initially provided as HTML drafts, must be transformed into interactive React components. They require hospital branding, logo, standardized header/footer, save/load/validation, digital signatures, auto-save, progress tracking, and professional PDF export, adhering to NABH standards for fantastic design and layout. The ongoing focus is on ensuring consistent branding and correct JSX across all implemented annexure forms.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully integrated a batch of 5 forms: L4 (Mental Health Support Request Tracker), L5 (Work-Life Balance Feedback Form), M1 (Grievance Filing Form), M2 (GRC Meeting Minutes Template), and M3 (Disciplinary Process Tracker). This involved extracting content, creating their respective  components, verifying JSX balance, updating imports, adding entries to the  array, and adding render cases in . The total count of integrated annexure forms was updated from 65 to 70.
