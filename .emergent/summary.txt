The AI engineer's trajectory primarily involves enhancing an HRMS dashboard for Koyili Hospital, focusing on legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures). Initial efforts delivered basic UI and navigation for these modules. A critical, repeated user request was for *exact, full content* from PDFs, not summaries, presented with professional formatting.

The engineer successfully implemented a premium UI for By-Laws and a fully interactive system for Annexures, including a board approval banner and sophisticated navigation. However, a significant misstep occurred when the user highlighted the By-Laws content was still incomplete despite the UI being enhanced. This prompted a lengthy, iterative process to systematically expand  from 30 sections to cover a 115-page document, addressing content overlaps, syntax errors, and structural issues across multiple phases. The engineer is currently in the final stages of populating the By-Laws content, having consistently received user prompts to proceed with next set of sections.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional hospital dashboard for Koyili Hospital with a comprehensive Human Resources Management System (HRMS). This system mandates modules for Employee Lifecycle, Advanced Leave, Payroll & Compensation, Document Management, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools. The design should be modern enterprise, drawing inspiration from SAP SuccessFactors/Workday and Notion, featuring an international standard with local adaptability, using Koyili Hospital/Avid Legal's blue-gold theme.

A core requirement is the exact extraction and professional presentation of legal documents: By-Laws, SOPs, and Annexures. This includes justified text, elegant typography, section-based interactive navigation, a dedicated sidebar for these documents that dynamically hides the main HR sidebar, and a prominent board approval banner. The previous engineer has successfully implemented the UI for By-Laws and a complete interactive system for Annexures. The ongoing task, explicitly requested by the user, is to provide the *complete, detailed content* for the By-Laws, ensuring no reduction or cutting short of the original 115-page document.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX Design**: Tailwind CSS, responsive design, custom animations, premium enterprise aesthetic.
-   **Data Handling**: MongoDB for persistence, structured JavaScript data files (e.g., , , ) for document content, comprehensive content extraction from PDFs (initially a promise, then actively being fulfilled).
-   **API Communication**: Frontend consumes backend APIs via  with  prefix.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central container and router for HR modules.
    -   Summary: Conditionally hides the HR sidebar for legal documents (, , ).
    -   Changes: Modified to render the new  component when  is 'hr-annexures', replacing the previous placeholder.
-   ****: Displays HR By-Laws.
    -   Summary: Core component for rendering By-Laws content with navigation and search.
    -   Changes: Significantly enhanced with premium and professional UI elements, including a board approval banner, improved header, quick reference cards, professional typography (serif fonts, justified text), and refined section rendering with dark headers and numbered bullets.
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR By-Laws.
    -   Summary: The data source for the  component.
    -   Changes: Initially incomplete, it has been systematically expanded across multiple phases to include comprehensive, detailed content for sections 3-30. The expansion process involved addressing syntax errors (unescaped apostrophes), cleaning up orphaned content, and ensuring logical flow by adjusting content for sections that overlapped with previous definitions (e.g., merging or replacing topics like medical benefits, workplace safety, IT policies). The file size has grown significantly (e.g., from 1281 lines to over 2500 lines) through multiple iterative updates.
-   ****: Displays HR Standard Operating Procedures.
    -   Summary: Component for rendering SOPs content, similar in layout to . No direct changes in this trajectory, but serves as a reference for expected content detail.
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR SOPs.
    -   Summary: The data source for . Used as a benchmark for the level of detail required for . No direct changes in this trajectory.
-   ****: Original placeholder for HR Annexures.
    -   Summary: Initial component for Annexures.
    -   Changes: Replaced by  in  to enable interactive features.
-   ****: New component for interactive HR Annexures.
    -   Summary: Created to provide a comprehensive, interactive annexures system.
    -   Changes: Implemented a premium dashboard with a board approval banner, interactive category grid, dedicated sidebar navigation, category view, individual form view with action buttons (Download PDF, Print Form, Fill Online), search functionality, statistics cards, and quick access to recently used forms.
-   ****: Stores structured content for HR Annexures.
    -   Summary: Placeholder data for Annexures categories and counts. No direct content changes in this trajectory, but  utilizes its structure.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining HRMS modules: Training and Reports.
-   Implement ready reckoner tools as interactive calculators.
-   Ensure forms (e.g., annexures) are actual downloadable PDFs with information cards.
-   Develop functionality for adding more departments dynamically.
-   Update  with the full, detailed content extracted from the provided PDF.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer has been systematically expanding the content of  to fulfill the user's explicit request for a complete, 115-page document content. This involves iteratively adding detailed content for all 30 sections, replacing previous terse descriptions with comprehensive legal text.

The work has been segmented into phases, with the engineer having completed content expansion for sections 3 through 22, and currently working on the final batch of sections (23-30). During this process, the engineer has encountered and resolved several syntax errors (e.g., unescaped apostrophes, orphaned lines, duplicate section definitions) that arose from the large-scale content injections and restructuring. The frontend has been successfully compiled and restarted multiple times to verify the changes. The user has consistently prompted the engineer to continue with the next set of sections, underscoring the priority of this content completion task. The  file has significantly increased in size, reflecting the ongoing detailed content insertion. The last action involved editing to expand the final sections (23-30), cleaning up old remnants, and adding proper final sections, and the engineer is about to check the line count and compile.

<optional_next_step>
Check the line count of , compile the frontend, and then restart the frontend to verify the expanded sections (23-30).
