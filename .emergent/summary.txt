The AI engineer's work has progressed through iterative phases for building a comprehensive HRMS within a hospital dashboard. Initially, the focus was on establishing a professional UI for login, header, sidebar, and footer, then expanding to various HR modules like Employee Management, Attendance/Leave, and Payroll. Significant effort was dedicated to refactoring UI components and fixing frontend syntax errors, demonstrating robust debugging.

Most recently, the work concentrated on a highly detailed and legally compliant presentation of HR By-Laws. This involved creating a dedicated component () with an interactive, section-based navigation sidebar and search functionality. The  was modified to dynamically hide the main HR sidebar when viewing legal documents. A crucial user request, stemming from an initial summary, was to incorporate the *entire, exact content* from provided PDF documents for By-Laws, SOPs, and Annexures, rather than summarized versions. The AI successfully extracted the complete By-Laws content and is currently in the process of extracting the SOPs content. This iteration emphasizes precise content extraction and display alongside advanced UI/UX for legal documents.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a hospital dashboard for Koyili Hospital, focusing on a Human Resources (HR) department view. Key requirements encompass a highly professional, international standard login page with specific hospital branding, a main dashboard featuring a header, footer, and a navigation sidebar (extensible for future departments), and responsive design. The core is a comprehensive HRMS dashboard, including Employee Lifecycle, Advanced Leave, Payroll & Compensation, Document Management, Performance, Recruitment, Training, Reports, and Tools modules. It needs demo employee data.

Design standards are modern enterprise (SAP SuccessFactors/Workday inspired with Notion minimalism), international appearance, local adaptability, and Koyili Hospital/Avid Legal's blue-gold color themes. A critical requirement is specific handling for legal documents (By-Laws, SOPs, Annexures): content must be exact from provided PDFs, presented with professional formatting (justified text, proper typography, bullets), interactive navigation (e.g., for 30 By-Laws sections), a dedicated sidebar for legal documents, hiding the main HR sidebar when viewing legal documents, and a board approval banner.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had implemented a comprehensive HR By-Laws component () featuring a dedicated sidebar with section-based navigation, search functionality, and a Back to HR Dashboard button. The  was updated to conditionally hide the main HR sidebar when By-Laws (or SOPs/Annexures) are viewed. After resolving a minor syntax error in , the frontend compiled successfully, and initial screenshots confirmed the login and dashboard functionality.

However, the user explicitly requested that the  component display the *entire, detailed content* from the provided 115-page PDF, rather than the initially implemented summarized version. The user also reiterated this requirement for  and , re-uploading the By-Laws and SOPs PDFs. The AI successfully extracted the complete detailed content for the By-Laws PDF. The current work in progress is the extraction of the complete detailed content for the SOPs PDF, following the user's latest explicit request.
